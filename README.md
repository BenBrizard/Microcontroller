# Microcontroller
Here I present the source code of the final project of the course ELE3312. Using an ultrasonic sensor, the program computes the distances between an object (like a hand) and the microcontroller. In function of the distance, the microcontroller outputs a musical note in real-time. It can mimicks several instruments. A menu is displayed on a LCD screen. There, the user can select an instrument, a mode and a musical scale. If the user enters a secret combination, he will discover special features. In these special modes, the microcontroller plays songs instead of sensing a distance. It can play Mario and Zelda theme songs.

The microcontroller used in this project is the STM32F446RE. If you want more details on the hardware used, please refer to the document "ELE3312 Projet final-v2.pdf" (french version only). This document explains in details the work the students had to do.
