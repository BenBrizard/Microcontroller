# Microcontroller
Here I present the source code of the final project of the course ELE3312. Using an ultrasonic sensor, the program computes the distances between an object and the microcontroller. In function of the distance, the microcontroller outputs a musical note. It can mimicks several instruments. There is also a user interface to choose between different musical scale. If the user enters a secret combination, he will discover special features. In these special modes, the microcontroller plays songs instead of sensing a distance. It can play Mario and Zelda theme songs
